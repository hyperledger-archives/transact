/// Defines the characteristics of a given state system.
///
/// A State system stores keys and values.  The keys and values may be made available via state
/// IDs, which define a checkpoint in the state. Keys that exist under one state ID are not
/// required to be available under another.  How this is handled is left up to the implementation.
///
/// For example, a `State` defined over a merkle database would proved the root merkle hash as its
/// state ID.
///
/// Available with the feature `"state-trait"` enabled.
pub trait State {
    /// A reference to a checkpoint in state. It could be a merkle hash for a merkle database.
    type StateId;
    /// The Key that is being stored in state.
    type Key;
    /// The Value that is being stored in state.
