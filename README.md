# Hyperledger Transact

Please do not merge me, I'm just playing.

Hyperledger Transact is a platform-agnostic library for executing transactions
with smart contracts.

- [This repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/transact) contains the core
  Transact Rust library.

- The [transact-contrib](https://github.com/hyperledger/transact-contrib)
  repository contains examples and reference implementations.

- The [transact-rfcs](https://github.com/hyperledger/transact-rfcs) repository
  contains RFCs (requests for comments) for proposed and approved changes to
  Hyperledger Transact.
