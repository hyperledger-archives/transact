# Hyperledger Transact

Hyperledger Transact is a platform-agnostic library for executing transactions
with smart contracts.

The Hyperledger Transact project includes several repositories:

- [This repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/transact) contains the core
  Transact Rust library.

- The [transact-contrib](https://github.com/hyperledger/transact-contrib)
  repository contains examples and reference implementations.

- The [transact-rfcs](https://github.com/hyperledger/transact-rfcs) repository
  contains RFCs (requests for comments) for proposed and approved changes to
  Hyperledger Transact.

## How to Participate

We welcome contributors, both organizations and individuals, to help shape
project direction, contribute ideas, provide use cases, and work on specific
tools and examples. Please join the discussion in the [mailing
list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/transact) and
[#transact](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/transact) channel.

### Inclusive Language

- Consider that users who will read the docs are from different background and
  cultures and that they have different preferences.
- Avoid potential offensive terms and, for instance, prefer "allow list and
  deny list" to "white list and black list".
- We believe that we all have a role to play to improve our world, and even if
  writing inclusive doc might not look like a huge improvement, it's a first
  step in the right direction.
- We suggest to refer to [Microsoft bias free writing
  guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication)
  and [Google inclusive doc writing
  guide](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation)
  as starting points.
