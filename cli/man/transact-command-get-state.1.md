```

The following shows submitting two get state transactions to a Splinter circuit
`kpHVT-sjpQM` with scabbard services. A Scabbard service runs a Sabre 
transaction handler. The command smart contract must already be uploaded to
scabbard.

```
transact command set-state \
  --key /alice.priv
  --target "http://0.0.0.0:8080/scabbard/kpHVT-sjpQM/gsAA"
  --address \
